# My Pet ID

Welcome to **My Pet ID**, a web app designed to help keep track of your pet's location and information using NFC tags. This app is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, making it easy for anyone to view your pet's profile and recent locations.

## How It Works

- **Scan the NFC Tag**: Use your phone to scan the NFC tag. If you’re the owner, your location will be updated in our database.
- **View the Profile**: Anyone can scan the tag to view the Dogs profile, including details and the last known locations (updated within the last 2 hours).
- **Account Features**: Create an account or log in to manage your profiles and update information (owner-only).

[Visit the My Pet ID App](https://mypetid-home.github.io/) to get started!

## Features

- View Dogs detailed profile, including personality, medical info, socials, and gallery.
- See the last known locations on a Google Map (updated dynamically via GitHub Actions).
- Report Dog as lost if you find them.
- Create an account or log in to manage pet details (owner-only).

## Coming Soon

- Integration with Tasker and NFC Tools Pro to automatically update location data when the owner scans the tag.
- Support for additional devices (e.g., family members’ phones) to update locations.
